# login-challenge

## Requirements

* Secure
* Email based
* Custom styling
* Statistics

## Assumtions

Any of these could be wrong...

* Looking at a login system for "The Product", not to be shared with something else
* *BigFish* is important enough to do custom work for (and we do that kind of work)
* Existing login system is "username" based

## Questions

* Is this a *new*, from scratch login system, or updates to an existing one (e.g. custom styles, email over username)?
* 3rd Party / Social login support needed?
* Do statistics integrate with another platform?
* Do existing "usernames" need converting or require notification of change to login
* What level of security (all login should be secure, but email/password is vulnerable. 2 Factor Auth needed?
