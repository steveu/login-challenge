# login-challenge

## Requirements

* Secure
* Email based
* Custom styling
* Statistics

## Assumtions

Any of these could be wrong...

* Looking at a login system for "The Product", not to be shared with something else
* *BigFish* is important enough to do custom work for (and we do that kind of work)

## Questions

* 3rd Party / Social login support needed?
* Do statistics integrate with another platform?
* Do we have existing "usernames" that would need converting or require notification of change to login
* What level of security (all login should be secure, but email/password is vulnerable. 2 Factor Auth needed?
